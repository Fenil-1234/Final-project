            In my online shopping website i had set total six section like mens womens, kids, and home and living, beauty, and studio. If you click on the mens section its bring you to mens outfits folder and show all the thing related to the mens.
            same as all the section if you navigate the different section so it brings to the their own folder.
        </p>
        <p> I also make profiloe so you also login through mail and also receive mail if any discount. Also make whitlist if you navigate this button its helps you to add your favourite things in it.
            Also add bag it shows you whatever you add on this bag and also show whatever you like and wht you add.
        </p>
